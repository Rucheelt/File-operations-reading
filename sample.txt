Pushpa Raj, born out of wedlock and thus facing societal stigma, begins as a humble daily wage laborer in the Seshachalam forests,
 where red sandalwood smuggling thrives. "Pushpa: The Rise" charts his rapid ascent. He quickly grasps the intricacies of the trade
 , demonstrating a shrewd understanding of supply chains and a fearless approach to risk. His resourcefulness and charisma propel him
  from a mere worker to a key player, managing transportation and outsmarting rivals. This rise, however, draws the attention of
   powerful figures, including the ruthless police officer, Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat, whose arrogance and brutality clash violently
    with Pushpa's defiant spirit. The film showcases Pushpa's growing influence, his establishment of a strong network, and his
     increasing wealth, all while navigating the dangers of the illegal trade and the constant threat of law enforcement. 
     The first film concludes with a tense confrontation, setting the stage for a bitter rivalry. "Pushpa 2: The Rule" continues 
     the narrative, depicting Pushpa as the undisputed kingpin of the red sandalwood smuggling empire. His power extends beyond the
      forest, permeating political circles and establishing him as a force to be reckoned with. The sequel delves into the escalating 
      conflict with Shekhawat, who seeks to dismantle Pushpa's empire and restore order. As Pushpa's influence grows, so does the 
      target on his back, with new rivals emerging and old enemies seeking revenge. The film explores the consequences of his power, 
      the challenges of maintaining control, and the inevitable clash between his ambition and the forces that seek to bring him 
      down.
